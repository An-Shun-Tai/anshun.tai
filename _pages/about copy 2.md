PI Short Bio.
-------
I received my Ph.D. in Statistics at National Tsing Hua University in 2019. My current research interests are the genomic data analysis and causal inference.

  * For genomic studies:
     Biological topics I have studied include tumor heterogeneity, immune cell deconvolution, and single-cell sequencing. Based on these topics, I have applied **Bayesian modeling**, **clustering approach**, and **variable selection** for developing the corresponding statistical models.

  * For causal inference:
    I recently focused on the statistical model development for mediator analysis with multiple mediators  and  instrumental variable method (**Mendelian Randomization**).  

I would welcome any email for an academic discussion.<br>
